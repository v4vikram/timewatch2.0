    question: "What is BIO-1SE and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "BIO-1SE is a biometric attendance and access control device developed by TimeWatch. It uses AI-powered face recognition, fingerprint scanning, palm detection, RFID cards, and password verification to track employee attendance and control facility access.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is BIO-1SE a contactless attendance system?",
    answer:
      "Yes. BIO-1SE offers face recognition and palm recognition, both of which are completely touchless. This makes it ideal for hospitals, labs, offices, and high-hygiene areas where avoiding surface contact is important.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can it be integrated with my existing HRMS or payroll software?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. BIO-1SE supports cloud integration with most HRMS and payroll systems, allowing real-time syncing of employee attendance, work hours, leave data, and more without manual input.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is BIO-1SE suitable for multiple locations or factory setups?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The device is designed for scalability. Whether you are managing offices in Delhi and Mumbai or factory sites in Dubai and Qatar, you can control access and attendance across all locations from a single dashboard.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens during a power cut? Will data be lost?",
    answer:
      "No. BIO-1SE has a built-in battery backup to ensure attendance logging continues during power failures. All data is securely stored and synced to the cloud once the network is back up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can use BIO-1SE — employees, visitors, or contractors?",
    answer:
      "BIO-1SE supports multiple authentication methods, including RFID cards and passwords. It is suitable for full-time employees, part-time workers, contractors, and even temporary visitors.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I get a demo or buy BIO-1SE?",
    answer:
      "You can request a free demo or place an order by calling us at +91 95999 53923 or emailing sales@timewatchindia.com. We provide support and installations across India and Gulf countries such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar.",
