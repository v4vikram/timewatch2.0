                <li>Smarter Shift & Roster Management</li>
                <p className="text-secondary mb-4">
                  Managing different shifts can be complex, especially for
                  industries like manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, and
                  24/7 operations. Our system simplifies this process with
                  automated shift detection, instantly recognizing an employeeâ€™s
                  clock-in time and mapping them to the correct schedule. For
                  situations requiring manual adjustments, HR professionals can
                  assign shifts directly in the system. It even supports
                  revolving rosters, ensuring smooth operations for teams
                  working on rotating, staggered, or night shifts.
                </p>
                <li>Intelligent Leave Management</li>
                <p>
                  Our platform allows you to define and manage multiple leave
                  types â€” from sick and earned leaves to maternity and paternity
                  â€” all aligned with your companyâ€™s HR policy. Leave records
                  sync automatically with attendance logs, eliminating data
                  mismatches. Employees and managers can view leave balances,
                  track requests, and manage approvals through a clean,
                  intuitive dashboard, creating a transparent and conflict-free
                  HR environment.
                </p>
                <li>Mobile Attendance with GPS and Photo Verification</li>
                <p>
                  For businesses with field agents, construction crews, or
                  remote workers, attendance tracking no longer requires
                  physical presence at the office. Through the TimeWatch mobile
                  app, employees can clock in and out from anywhere. The system
                  captures GPS location in real-time and records a photo for
                  verification, ensuring only authorized entries are registered.
                  This is ideal for sales teams, traveling technicians, and
                  distributed teams working on-site.
                </p>
                <li>Handling Exceptional Attendance Cases</li>
                  <p>
                Real-world operations often face missed punches or technical
                disruptions. TimeWatch addresses this with an admin-supervised
                manual punch feature, allowing HR or supervisors to record
                attendance in exceptional cases. These entries are stored with a
                full audit trail for accountability, and rules can be set for
                strict approval workflows.
              </p>
              <li>Real-Time Reporting & Insights</li>
                <p>
                With TimeWatch, managers no longer have to wait for end-of-month
                reconciliations. Detailed attendance reports are generated
                instantly and can be filtered by location, department, shift, or
                employee groups. Data can be exported in Excel or PDF format
                with a single click, and our cloud hosting ensures reports are
                accessible 24/7, keeping organizations audit-ready at all times.

               <p>
                Different roles require different levels of access. TimeWatch
                provides a multi-level permission system for HR staff,
                department managers, team leaders, and employees, ensuring
                confidentiality of sensitive salary and personal data while
                allowing smooth collaboration.

                Whether your organization uses face recognition, RFID cards,
                fingerprint scanners, or palm readers, our platform integrates
                effortlessly with TimeWatch biometric devices. Data syncs
                instantly with the cloud, removing any risk of loss or
                duplication, even in environments with fluctuating connectivity.

              <p className="text-secondary mb-4">
                Our payroll module is tightly integrated with attendance
                tracking, ensuring that every working hour, leave day, and
                overtime minute is accurately calculated. Businesses can set up
                multiple pay structures with allowances, deductions, and
                incentives tailored to different employee roles. The system
                automatically handles statutory compliance for EPF, ESI, TDS,
                Gratuity, Professional Tax, and other labour laws, helping
                organizations avoid compliance headaches.
              </p>
              <p>
                From bonus payouts to loan deductions, everything is automated.
                Payslips are generated instantly and can be downloaded or
                emailed directly to employees. Even full-and-final settlements
                for departing staff are calculated without manual intervention,
                ensuring quick, error-free processing. This reduces HR workload,
                eliminates human error, and keeps the organization ready for
                audits or inspections.
