              Live tracking empowers managers to monitor the exact location of
              field staff in real time, creating greater transparency and
              oversight for distributed teams. This feature is especially
              valuable for businesses with employees working outside the
              office—such as sales representatives, service technicians,
              delivery personnel, or property inspectors.

              <h2>Live Tracking</h2>
              <h3>(1) How It Works:</h3>

              <p className="text-secondary mb-4">
                Once an employee logs into the mobile app and grants location
                permission, their device begins sharing location data with the
                management dashboard automatically. This happens at set
                intervals, like every 10 or 25 minutes, ensuring managers
                receive timely updates on each staff member’s whereabouts
                throughout the workday.
              </p>
              <h3>(2) Real-Life Example:</h3>
              <p>
                Imagine a logistics company with several delivery drivers
                responsible for different routes across the city. With live
                tracking enabled, dispatch managers can view each driver's
                location on a map at any given moment. If a high-priority
                delivery request comes in, the manager immediately knows which
                driver is nearby and can assign the task efficiently. This
                reduces delays, improves service response, and optimizes
                delivery routes—ultimately benefiting both company performance
                and customer satisfaction.
              </p>
              <h3>(3) Key Features and Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Automatic Location Sharing: No manual check-ins required;
                  location updates are sent in the background without disrupting
                  employee workflow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Customizable Intervals: Managers can set the frequency of
                  location updates (e.g., every 10, 15, or 25 minutes) based on
                  operational needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enhanced Safety: Helps ensure employees are on their
                  designated routes or sites, and can be quickly located if an
                  emergency arises.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operational Efficiency: Enables resource allocation and
                  coordination in real time, reducing idle time and improving
                  productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accountability: Deters time theft and unauthorized breaks,
                  fostering a culture of trust and responsibility among field
                  workers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Historical Location Data: Stores route history and site visits
                  for future analysis, dispute resolution, and operational
                  planning.
                </li>

                <strong>
                  Imagine a logistics company with several delivery drivers
                  responsible for different routes across the city. With live
                  tracking enabled, dispatch managers can view each driver's

                </strong>
              </p>

              <h3>(1) How It Works:</h3>
              <p>
                Managers assign specific tasks or site visits—such as visiting
                locations A, B, and C—to their field employees through a
                centralized platform. When the employee arrives at each
                designated location, they use the mobile application to mark
                their attendance. This attendance punch is verified with three
                key data points: the exact GPS location, the time of check-in,
                and a photo taken onsite as proof of presence.
              </p>
              <h3>(2) Real-Life Scenario:</h3>
              <p>
                Imagine a property inspection company that requires its
                inspectors to visit multiple client sites each day. Upon
                reaching each site (for example, Location A, B, and C), the
                inspector opens the mobile app and punches in. The app
                automatically captures the precise location via GPS, logs the
                timestamp, and prompts the inspector to take a photo of the
                property or work completed. This process ensures that the
                attendance record accurately confirms the inspector’s visit and
                presence.
              </p>

              <h3>(3) Benefits and Key Features:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Accurate Location and Time Tracking: Each attendance mark is
                  tied to exact GPS coordinates and an accurate timestamp to
                  prevent any possibility of false check-ins from unauthorized
                  locations
                </li>
                <li>
                  Photo Authentication: Capturing a photo during punch-in adds
                  an additional layer of security and authenticity, deterring
                  fraudulent attendance claims.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Task Completion Visibility: Managers can easily track whether
                  assigned tasks or site visits have been completed at the
                  specified locations, ensuring accountability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Comprehensive Monthly Reports: At month-end, detailed and
                  easy-to-understand reports provide insights into attendance
                  patterns, task completion rates, total hours worked, and
                  locations visited. These reports include automated
                  calculations that simplify payroll processing and performance
                  assessment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improved Workforce Productivity: With clear evidence of task
                  completion and attendance, organizations can identify
                  productivity trends, optimize field operations, and address
                  any inefficiencies promptly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Streamlined Payroll and Compliance: Verified attendance and
                  work reports reduce payroll errors and ensure compliance with
                  labor regulations, enhancing organizational transparency.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
