                <strong>university in Delhi with thousands of students</strong>,

              <h2>Key Features & Real-World Use Cases</h2>
             <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
  <li><strong>Touchless & Secure Meal Access:</strong> Employees can use face recognition, fingerprint, or RFID cards to collect meals without coupons. <em>Example:</em> In an IT park in Gurugram, only authorized employees can access the cafeteria, reducing misuse and saving costs.</li>

  <li><strong>Menu Scheduling & Multi-Shift Support:</strong> Supports 255 menu items and up to 9 meal slots per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks). <em>Example:</em> A factory in Chennai running 24x7 can easily manage different menus for day and night shifts.</li>

  <li><strong>Cashless Transactions with Auto Recharge:</strong> Employees pay via UPI, prepaid wallet, or RFID card, with instant auto-recharge. <em>Example:</em> In a Delhi corporate office, staff recharge online and skip queues, making lunch breaks faster.</li>

  <li><strong>Real-Time Tracking & Reports:</strong> Every transaction is recorded with user, time, and item details. <em>Example:</em> In a hospital in Hyderabad, HR tracks staff consumption separately from visitor meals to ensure transparency.</li>

  <li><strong>Smart Food Planning & Waste Reduction:</strong> By syncing with attendance data, the system predicts the number of meals required daily. <em>Example:</em> A Gujarat factory reduced food wastage by 20% using attendance-linked forecasting.</li>

  <li><strong>Integration with Payroll & HRMS:</strong> Meal allowances or deductions can be auto-calculated and synced with payroll. <em>Example:</em> In a Bangalore SME, contractor meals are deducted directly from invoices, saving admin effort.</li>
</ul>
