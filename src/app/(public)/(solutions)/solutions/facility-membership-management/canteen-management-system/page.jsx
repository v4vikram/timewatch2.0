                TimeWatchâ€™s <strong>Canteen Management System</strong> is
                designed for{" "}
                <strong>
                  Indian corporates, factories, hospitals, and universities,
                </strong>{" "}
                where thousands of meals are served daily.{" "}
                <strong>
                  By combining biometric authentication, RFID cards, cashless
                  payments, and real-time reporting,
                </strong>{" "}
                we make dining simple, secure, and cost-effective for both
                employees and management.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whether itâ€™s a{" "}
                <strong> factory in Pune with multiple shifts</strong>, a{" "}
                <strong>university in Delhi with thousands of students</strong>,
                or a{" "}
                <strong>
                  corporate office in Bangalore with multiple cafeterias
                </strong>
                , our system ensures every meal is tracked, fair, and
                hassle-free.
              </p>

              <h2>Key Features & Real-World Use Cases</h2>
              <h3 className="!mt-0">(1) Touchless & Secure Meal Access</h3>
              <p>
                Employees can use{" "}
                <strong>face recognition, fingerprint, or RFID cards</strong>
                to collect meals without coupons. Example: In an{" "}
                <strong>IT park in Gurugram</strong>, only authorized employees
                can access the cafeteria, reducing misuse and saving costs.
              </p>
              <h3>(2) Menu Scheduling & Multi-Shift Support</h3>
              <p>
                Supports <strong>255 menu items</strong> and up to{" "}
                <strong>9 meal slots per day</strong> (breakfast, lunch, dinner,
                snacks). Example: <strong>A factory in Chennai</strong> running
                24x7 can easily manage different menus for day and night shifts.
              </p>
              <h3>(3) Cashless Transactions with Auto Recharge</h3>
              <p>
                Employees pay via UPI, prepaid wallet, or RFID card, with
                instant auto-recharge. Example: In a Delhi corporate office,
                staff recharge online and skip queues, making lunch breaks
                faster.
              </p>
              <h3>(4) Real-Time Tracking & Reports</h3>
              <p>
                Every transaction is recorded with user, time, and item details.
                Example: In a <strong>hospital in Hyderabad</strong>, HR tracks
                staff consumption separately from visitor meals to ensure
                transparency.
              </p>
              <h3>(5) Smart Food Planning & Waste Reduction</h3>
              <p>
                By syncing with attendance data, the system predicts the number
                of meals required daily. Example: A{" "}
                <strong>Gujarat factory</strong> reduced food wastage by 20%
                using attendance-linked forecasting.
              </p>
              <h3>(6) Integration with Payroll & HRMS</h3>
              <p>
                Meal allowances or deductions can be auto-calculated and synced
                with payroll. Example: In a <strong>Bangalore SME</strong>,
                contractor meals are deducted directly from invoices, saving
                admin effort.
              </p>
