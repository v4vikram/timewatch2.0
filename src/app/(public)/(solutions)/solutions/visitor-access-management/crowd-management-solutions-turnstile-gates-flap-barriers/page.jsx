                  users can enter.
                </li>

              </ul>

              <h2>Where Our Crowd Management Solutions Are Used</h2>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Metro & Railway Stations:</strong> Indian metros and
                  railway stations see lakhs of passengers daily. Flap barriers
                  and turnstiles help regulate passenger entry during peak
                  hours, prevent overcrowding, and reduce ticket fraud by
                  integrating with RFID or QR-based ticketing systems. They
                  ensure safe, efficient, and reliable movement for daily
                  commuters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Airports:</strong>
                  Airports handle continuous passenger flow across multiple
                  checkpoints. Turnstile gates streamline security, immigration,
                  and boarding processes, ensuring only authorized passengers
                  enter restricted zones. With biometric or QR scanning,
                  airports can reduce congestion, enhance operational
                  efficiency, and improve overall passenger safety.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Schools, Colleges & Universities:</strong>Educational
                  institutions require secure access for students, staff, and
                  visitors. Flap barriers prevent unauthorized entry, while
                  biometric or ID card integration keeps accurate records. This
                  reduces trespassing risks, ensures student safety, and aligns
                  with modern institutional security standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Stadiums & Sports Arenas :</strong> From IPL cricket
                  matches to football tournaments, stadiums in India attract
                  tens of thousands of fans. Flap barriers and turnstiles help
                  control entry gates, validate tickets, and prevent
                  unauthorized access. They ensure smooth crowd movement, safe
                  entry and exit, and minimize chaos during large sporting or
                  entertainment events.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Corporate Offices & IT Parks :</strong> Large
                  workplaces with thousands of employees and visitors daily
                  require automated access management. Turnstile gates allow
                  seamless entry through RFID, biometric, or QR, while
                  preventing tailgating. This improves security, reduces manual
                  checks, and maintains detailed logs for audits and compliance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Shopping Malls & Events:</strong> Shopping malls,
                  exhibitions, and cultural events in India face heavy visitor
                  rush during weekends and festive sales. Flap barriers regulate
                  visitor flow, reduce security risks, and prevent overcrowding.
                  This ensures a safe, enjoyable experience for customers and
                  event attendees.
