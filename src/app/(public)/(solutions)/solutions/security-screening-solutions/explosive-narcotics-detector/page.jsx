              <h3>(1) Dual-Mode Detection</h3>
              <p>
                The TW-NE200 combines two modes in one device—explosives and
                narcotics detection—ensuring complete coverage.
              </p>

              <h3>(2) Rapid Results</h3>
              <p>
                Provides test results in three seconds or less, improving
                security screening efficiency.
              </p>

              <h3>(3) High Accuracy and Low False Alarms</h3>
              <p>
                With an accuracy rate above 99% and a false alarm rate of less
                than 1%, it delivers dependable results.
              </p>
              <h3>(4) Safe and Simple Sampling</h3>
              <p>
                Operators can collect trace particles using wipe samples without
                directly handling suspicious materials.
              </p>

              <h3>(5) Portable and Easy to Operate</h3>
