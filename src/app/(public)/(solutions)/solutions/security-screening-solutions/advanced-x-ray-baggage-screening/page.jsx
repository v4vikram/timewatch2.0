              <h3>(1) High-Definition X-Ray Imaging with AI Overlays</h3>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Utilizing advanced algorithms, the system enhances images using
                multiple filters—such as edge, density, and color
                enhancements—for clear visibility. Dangerous items are
                automatically flagged with AI overlay boxes that track movement
                across the image.
              </p>

              <h3>(2) Enhanced Threat Detection with Smart Alarm System</h3>
              <p>
                The scanner identifies hazardous items like knives, lighters,
                liquids, and electronics, and triggers alarms via voice, light,
                and belt stoppage. Each threat is logged and categorized for
                later review.
              </p>

              <h3>(3) Dual Camera Monitoring & Robust Storage</h3>
              <p>
                Equipped with entrance and exit cameras plus optional PoE/IP
                cameras for live surveillance and playback. Enables recording
                patient-package insights and stores up to millions of images,
                supported by RAID-based backup.
              </p>

              <h3>(4) Flexible Display Modes & Image Manipulation</h3>
              <p>
                Operates in security or surveillance modes. Supports image
                enhancements such as inversion, pseudo-color, organic stripping,
                and high-energy contrast—all to improve object visibility and
                accuracy.
              </p>

              <h3>(5) User-Friendly Interface & Reliable Diagnostics</h3>
              <p>
                Operates on embedded Linux with intuitive GUIs and web access.
                Includes self-diagnostics, error logs, user management, and
                seamless remote updates.
