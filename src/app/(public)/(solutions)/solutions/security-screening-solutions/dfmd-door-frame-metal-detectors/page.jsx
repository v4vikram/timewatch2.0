              <p className="mb-4">
                In today’s world, managing security at busy entry points like
                airports, metro stations, stadiums, schools, and corporate
                offices is a growing challenge. TimeWatch brings a reliable,
                accurate, and easy-to-use solution with its Door Frame Metal
                Detectors (DFMDs).
              </p>

              <p>
                Unlike older detectors that only give a generic alert, TimeWatch
                DFMDs use multi-zone technology to pinpoint the exact body
                location of a concealed metal object. This not only increases
                detection accuracy but also reduces screening delays, making it
                easier for security staff to handle high footfall without
                compromising on safety.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whether you’re in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Dubai,
                Doha, or Riyadh, our DFMDs are trusted for seamless entry
                control in both public and private spaces.
              </p>

              <h2>Key Features of TimeWatch DFMDs</h2>
              <h3>(1) Multi-Zone Precision</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  TimeWatch DFMDs are available in 6-zone, 12-zone, and 24-zone
                  models, ensuring every site has the right fit.
                </strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  6-Zone DFMD – Best for schools, colleges, small offices, and
                  clinics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  6-Zone DFMD – Best for schools, colleges, small offices, and
                  clinics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  24-Zone DFMD – Designed for high-security facilities like
                  airports, metro stations, embassies, corporate data centers,
                  and stadiums where precision is critical.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Every zone’s sensitivity can be customized. For example,
                airports in Mumbai or Dubai can set a high sensitivity level to
                detect even small knives, while a school in Lucknow or Chennai
                may choose a moderate level to avoid unnecessary alarms from
                coins or belt buckles.
              </p>

              <h3>(2) Rapid Setup & Easy Operation</h3>
              <p>
                Security teams don’t need advanced training. Most models can be
                installed in less than 20 minutes, with a user-friendly LCD
                display that shows footfall, alerts, and alarm zones in
                real-time.
              </p>
              <h3>(3) Visual & Audio Indicators</h3>
              <p>
                The LED indicators on the sides show the exact body part where
                metal is detected, while buzzers and alarms immediately notify
                guards. This helps speed up checks, especially in high-traffic
                areas like metro stations and sports stadiums.
              </p>

              <h3>(4) Built-In Traffic Counters</h3>
              <p>
                Each unit records how many people have walked through and how
                many alarms were triggered. This is particularly useful in audit
                reports, event planning, and crowd management.
              </p>
              <h3>(5) Safe for Everyone</h3>
              <p>
                Our DFMDs are completely safe for pregnant women, people with
                pacemakers, and electronic devices, making them suitable for
                hospitals, schools, and universities.
              </p>
