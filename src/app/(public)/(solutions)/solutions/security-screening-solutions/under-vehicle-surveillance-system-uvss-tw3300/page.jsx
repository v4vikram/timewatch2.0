              <h2>How TW3300 UVSS Works</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Vehicle Enters Checkpoint</strong> â€“ As the vehicle
                  passes over the scanning unit, high-resolution cameras capture
                  continuous images.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Image Processing</strong> â€“ The system instantly
                  processes and displays the underside of the vehicle on the
                  operatorâ€™s monitor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>License Plate Recognition</strong> â€“ With ALPR
                  integration, vehicle details are automatically recorded and
                  matched with access permissions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Operator Review</strong> â€“ Security personnel can
                  zoom, adjust contrast, or enhance images for a closer
                  inspection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data Storage</strong> â€“ Images and vehicle logs are
                  saved for compliance, audits, and investigations.
                </li>
              </ol>
