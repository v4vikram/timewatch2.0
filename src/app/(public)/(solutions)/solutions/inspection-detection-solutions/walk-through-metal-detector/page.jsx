                  <strong>8-Zone Detection System:</strong> The device is
                  equipped with 8 detection zones, allowing security personnel
                  to pinpoint the exact location of metallic objects on the body
                  (head, torso, arms, or legs). This ensures quicker inspections
                  and reduces delays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Adjustable Sensitivity Levels:</strong> Operators can
                  fine-tune sensitivity to detect even small metallic objects
                  like blades or concealed weapons, while minimizing false
                  alarms from harmless items such as keys or belts.
                </li>
                <li>

                  disrupting passenger flow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>High Throughput Screening:</strong> Built to handle
                  heavy traffic, the detector ensures that thousands of people
                  can be screened efficiently each day without compromising
                  accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>User-Friendly Operation:</strong> With its simple
                  interface, plug-and-play installation, and reliable
                  performance, security staff can operate the system without
                  extensive training.
