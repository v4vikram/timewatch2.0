                This system ensures drivers and passengers remain outside the
                vehicle during scanning, making the process completely safe from
                radiation exposure. With its powerful 200KV or optional 320KV
                X-ray generator and high-resolution L-shaped detectors, TimeScan
                provides unmatched penetration and crystal-clear imaging.
              </p>
              <p>
