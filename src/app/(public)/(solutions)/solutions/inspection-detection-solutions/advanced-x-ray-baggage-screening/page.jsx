             <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
  <li><strong>High-Definition X-Ray Imaging with AI Overlays:</strong> Utilizing advanced algorithms, the system enhances images using multiple filtersâ€”such as edge, density, and color enhancementsâ€”for clear visibility. Dangerous items are automatically flagged with AI overlay boxes that track movement across the image.</li>

  <li><strong>Enhanced Threat Detection with Smart Alarm System:</strong> The scanner identifies hazardous items like knives, lighters, liquids, and electronics, and triggers alarms via voice, light, and belt stoppage. Each threat is logged and categorized for later review.</li>

  <li><strong>Dual Camera Monitoring & Robust Storage:</strong> Equipped with entrance and exit cameras plus optional PoE/IP cameras for live surveillance and playback. Enables recording patient-package insights and stores up to millions of images, supported by RAID-based backup.</li>

  <li><strong>Flexible Display Modes & Image Manipulation:</strong> Operates in security or surveillance modes. Supports image enhancements such as inversion, pseudo-color, organic stripping, and high-energy contrastâ€”all to improve object visibility and accuracy.</li>

  <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface & Reliable Diagnostics:</strong> Operates on embedded Linux with intuitive GUIs and web access. Includes self-diagnostics, error logs, user management, and seamless remote updates.</li>

  <li><strong>Comprehensive Scene Applications:</strong> Ideal for high-security or high-volume environments including airports, metro stations, government buildings, large event venues, and logistics hubs.</li>
